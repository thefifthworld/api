# The Fifth World API

This API provides the means of interacting with the Fifth World database. Even the Fifth World website uses this API.

We'll be writing robust API documentation in the months ahead, hosted on the Fifth World website. When that happens, we'll be expanding this README, including with a link to that documentation.
