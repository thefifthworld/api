      <h1>Quick Start</h1>
      <p>Walking you through the steps of how to build a site or app lies beyond what we can cover here. We'll
        make reference to how we did things for the Fifth World website (which we built with JavaScript using
        <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a>, <a href="https://expressjs.com">Express.js</a>, and
        <a href="http://passportjs.org">Passport.js</a>, but you'll have to figure out how that maps to your
        own project yourself.

        <h2>Example: The Fifth World Map</h2>
        <p>Let's say that you want to create a web app that shows all of the publicly-available locations
          listed on the Fifth World website. In this case, you really just need one endpoint: the
          <a href="/docs/ref/pages/get-pages">Get pages endpoint</a>. Since you just want the publicly-available
      locations, you don&rsquo;t even need to authenticate.
      <h2>Example: The Fifth World Writer's App</h2>
      <p>Let's say you want to provide a distraction-free writing environment specifically for writing
        stories set in the Fifth World. You have some ideas for soothing jungle sounds and a nice background
        and some subtle animations that you think will really help writers focus and feel the setting
        (actually, this sounds pretty great, maybe we should add it to our roadmap&hellip;)</p>
      <p>For this app, you'll need to deal with <a href="auth.html">authentication</a>>. After all,
        you don't want every writer who uses your app to write stories credited to <em>you</em>, you want them to
        write their <em>own</em> stories. That means you'll have to give your users the chance to log in. That
        will mean making requests to the <a href="/docs/ref/members/post-auth">authentication endpoint</a>
        to get a JSON Web  Token. You'll have to keep this token handy. Cookies work great for a website or
        web app, but in this case we want to make a native app, so we store it as a variable on the device.
        Since the token expires after 15 minutes, we'll need to make a request to the
        <a href="/docs/ref/members/post-reauth">renew authentication endpoint</a>
        in the background a little more frequently than that to make sure that our token doesn't expire.</p>
      <p>Next, the user goes to our lovely writing screen. Our writers might not know what they want to call
        their stories at first, so we don't bother them with such things just yet. We keep it local on the
        device and autosave every minute or so. But when you tell us your finished, you back out of the
        writing environment to a page that shows you all of your current drafts. From here, you can choose
        to publish a story. There we ask you for anything still missing that a page will need, like title,
        if we should make it the child of any other page, and tags like author, or if we should treat this
        as a chapter of a longer work. Once we have all of that, the user presses the <em>Publish</em> button, and
        our app makes a call to the <a href="/docs/ref/pages/post-pages">Create a new page endpoint</a>
        to publish the page.</p>
      <p>After the user has published her first story, we have a list of stories in various states of
        publication &mdash; some she's begun on our app, some she's begun on the site, and some published. So
        now we need to make our list of drafts a little more complicated, combining the list we have locally
        on the device with the results of a call to the <a href="/docs/ref/pages/get-pages">Get pages endpoint</a>.
        Since we're supplying the user's token, we'll even get unpublished pages that she's created on the site
        that only she can see. We copy all of those pages to the list we keep on the device, and we add some data
        in the background that associates the unique path of a published story with the copy we're keeping locally,
        which also  helps us tell which ones we've published and which we haven't.</p>
      <p>Now when the user visits the page with her drafts, we make a quick check to the\
        <a href="/docs/ref/pages/get-pages">Get pages endpoint</a> to  potentially update our list, just in case
        anything has changed. And when she publishes changes to  stories that she's already published, we use
        the path we've saved to know to send our request to the <a href="/docs/ref/pages/post-pages-path">Update
        page endpoint</a>(using the path we have for the published story) instead of simply posting to the
        <a href="/docs/ref/pages/post-pages">Create a new page endpoint</a>.</p>

        <h3>Exmaple: The Fifth World Website</h3>
        <p>The two examples above &mdash; at least for the time being &mdash; remain hypothetical. For a solid,
        real-world example of how you might use the Fifth World API, take a look at the
        <a href="https://github.com/thefifthworld/server">source code</a> for the Ffith World website,
        available on <a href="https://github.com/thefifthworld">GitHub</a>.</p>
